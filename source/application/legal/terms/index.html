				<p>Crypto / digital asset trading is highly risky and highly volatile, and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. Risks associated with The XStudio Token may lose up to the full value of the funds. The Bitcoin Blockchain network, like all existing ones, is a High-risk investment. The XStudio Token (111) participants assume the risk associated with project development and deployment.</p>

				<p>We shall have no liability for damages of any kind arising out of the use, reference to or reliance on the contents of this White Paper, even if advised of the possibility of damages arising.</p>

				<p>No regulatory authority has examined or approved any of the information set out in this project. No such action has or will be taken under the laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any jurisdiction. The publication, distribution or dissemination of this project does not imply that applicable laws or regulatory requirements have been complied with.</p>

				<p>This project is intended for people who have experience purchasing blockchain tokens. If you have not regularly participated in prior token sales, nor fully understand the risks associated with it, we strongly advise against participating in The XStudio sale. Each participant fully accepts any risks associated in the process of the token sales, distribution and accepts that no guarantees will be made for the tradability of the token, nor protection against the exposure of volatility which may occur, resulting in a large difference in the value between the purchase date and the date The XStudio is tradable. By participating in The XStudio and by acquiring The XStudio you acknowledge that the primary function of The XStudio token is enabling The XStudio Ecosystem, and not being a value storage asset.</p>

				<p>Also, you accept that blockchain tokens inherently come with great risks, such as loss of value, theft, hacking or other complete loss of tokens, loss of usability and security, and other weaknesses in The XStudio or third-party software. Please be aware that it is your own responsibility to adequately hold, store and trade The XStudio tokens, for instance by choosing a compatible wallet. If you do not fully understand these risks and obligations, we encourage you to get informed or obtain relevant counsel or to abstain from any involvement.</p>

				<h2>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING ("AML") POLICY</h2>
				<p>(a) The XStudio expressly prohibits and rejects the use of the Service for any form of illicit activity, including money laundering, terrorist financing or trade sanctions violations, consistent with various jurisdictions' laws, regulations, and norms. By using the Service, you represent that you are not involved in any such activity.</p>

				<h3>Assignment</h3>
				<p>The XStudio reserves the right to assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without notice. The User may not assign any of his/her rights or obligations under this Agreement.</p>

				<h3>Risks</h3>
				<p>Obviously, there are some risks, but we are doing our best to manage them well.</p>
				<p>Cryptocurrency trading can be extremely risky. Cryptocurrency trading may not generally be appropriate, particularly with funds drawn from retirement savings, student loans, mortgages, emergency funds, or funds set aside for other purposes. Cryptocurrency trading can lead to large and immediate financial losses. The volatility and unpredictability of the price of cryptocurrency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time. Transactions in cryptocurrency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</p>
				<p>Purchasing cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, fraud, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same control or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment at the present time will continue doing so in the future.</p>
				<p>Before investing in a blockchain project, investors must be aware of all the risks involved in this project. They must accept that investing in The XStudio project may be at a high risk of losing money and investing in The XStudio is no exception to the above-mentioned risks.</p>
				<p>The project roadmap may change for any reason without any notice.</p>
